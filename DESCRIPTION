Description: A lightweight R package for creating Table 1, which typically
    contains descriptive information about persons under study in statistical
    analyses. Table 1 provides summary statistics for baseline characteristics.
    Features include automatic variable type detection, flexible summary
    statistics (mean/median, SD/IQR), optional standardized mean differences
    (SMD) for group comparisons, and multi-column tables for comparing multiple
    subgroups. Supports YAML specification for easy variable definition. Core
    functionality uses only base R; YAML parsing requires the 'yaml' package
    (suggested dependency).
