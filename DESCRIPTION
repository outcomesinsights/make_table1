Description: A lightweight, dependency-free R package for creating Table 1,
    which typically contains descriptive information about persons under study
    in statistical analyses. Table 1 provides summary statistics for baseline
    characteristics. Features include automatic variable type detection, flexible
    summary statistics (mean/median, SD/IQR), optional standardized mean
    differences (SMD) for group comparisons, and multi-column tables for
    comparing multiple subgroups. Uses only base R with no external dependencies.
